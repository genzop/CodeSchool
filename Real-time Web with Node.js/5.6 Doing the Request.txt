5.6 Doing the Request
Next, we'll use the request module to make a simple web request and log the response to the console. You can use this example in the README.

	- To start, require the request module and assign the return function to a variable.
	- Next, issue a request to searchURL. Remember, the callback function for the request function takes three arguments: error, response and body.
	- Finally, log the response body to the console using console.log().
