1.3 Convert Blocking
Not everyone knows why it's important to write non-blocking programs in Node.js. One of these unfortunate souls has written some code to read a file off the file-system using the blocking function readFileSync. Convert the code to be non-blocking using the readFile function instead.

	- Start by changing the call from readFileSync() to readFile().
	- Next, add a callback method to the readFile() call. This method should accept error and contents parameters.
	- To finish it up, remove the contents var declaration, and move the call to console.log() inside your callback.
