2.2 Chat Emitter 
We're going to create a custom chat EventEmitter.

	- Create a new EventEmitter object and assign it to a variable called 'chat'.
	- Next, let's listen for the 'message' event on our new chat object. Remember to add a callback that accepts the message parameter.
	- Log the message to the console using console.log().
