2.5 Script Tags
Now we can add some client-side JavaScript by including the jquery.js and client.js files.

	- Within index.html, include jquery.js using a <script> tag.
	- Within index.html, include client.js using a <script> tag.
	- Now in the client.js file, complete the code for the $.get function so that it calls the /cities URL path, and then runs the appendToList function.
