1.6 Cities
In order to better reflect the domain of our application, we want to change our existing route from /locations to /cities.

	- First, change our existing route from /locations to /cities.
	- Now create a new route for /locations.
	- Now redirect from /locations to /cities path using the Moved Permanently HTTP status code (free hint for you, the code for that is 301).
