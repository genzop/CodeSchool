4.3 Template Property Binding
We've gone ahead and applied new HTML and CSS to our app to make it prettier. We also have two new fields in our model and mocks: image and imageDescription.

	- Use property binding to display our race images in the <img> tag weâ€™ve added.
	- Use property binding to add an alt attribute to each of our images that contains the value of our imageDescription.
	- Use class binding to optionally add the racing css class to our <li> if we are racing in this race.
