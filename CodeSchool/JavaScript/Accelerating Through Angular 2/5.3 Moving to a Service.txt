5.3 Moving to a Service
It's time to move our mocks into services for our racing schedule app. We've gone ahead and started creating a race.service.ts file for you. Please note that this is a RaceService class, not RacingDataService class like in the slides. We need your help hooking it all up.

	- First, in the race.service.ts file, import the @Injectable decorator and use it properly with our RaceService class.
	- Great! Now, in the main.ts, import our RaceService and let our module know about it.
	- Good job! Now, in the races.component.ts, import the service and create the constructor that will allow it to be injected.
	- Lastly, finish implementing our ngOnInit() to call our new service and fetch our races using the getRaces() method.
