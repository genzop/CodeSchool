/*1.5 From a While Loop to a For Loop
In countdown.js, write a basic for loop that prints to the console all the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. This is the similar to one of the previous challenges, but this time weâ€™re using a for loop instead of a while loop.
Here is what our while loop looked like from the previous challenge:

	var num = 10;
	while (num > 0) {
  		console.log(num);
  		num--;
	}
*/

for(var num = 10; num > 0; num--){
  console.log(num);
}
