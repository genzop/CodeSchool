/*5.7 2D Arrays II
Now alert a string with the full title of the first movie in the eightiesMovies array, but only using the eightiesMovies variable to access the correct values. Use the concatenation operator to unite the words into one string, and remember to be attentive to necessary whitespace!

	var movie1 = [16, "Candles"];
	var movie2 = [3, "Men", "and", "a", "Baby"];
	var eightiesMovies = [movie1, movie2];*/

alert(eightiesMovies[0][0] + " " + eightiesMovies[0][1]);
