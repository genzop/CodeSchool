1.4 A New Route and a Root Route
Practice using when() by creating a route for new notes and a route for the root of the application.

	- Create a new route which maps /notes/new to the notes edit.html template.
	- Create a route for / that redirects to the /users index page.
	- Create a default route that will redirect the user to /notes when an undefined route is used.
