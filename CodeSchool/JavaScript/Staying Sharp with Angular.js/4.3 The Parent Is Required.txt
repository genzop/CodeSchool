4.3 The Parent Is Required
The nwNavItem directive needs to be able to communicate with the parent nwNav directive in order to tell when a nav item should be active. Let's go ahead and set that up.

	- Within the nwNavItem directive, use the require option to gain access to the controller from the parent nwNav directive.
	- Give the nwNavItem directive a link function. Make sure to fill in all the arguments so that we have access to the controller required from the previous task.
