4.2 Glorious Directives for Our Navigation
NoteWrangler navigation has now been broken into two parts: the children — nw-nav-item — and the parent — nw-nav.

Help the children and parent communicate by using what we have learned about $scope and link. They'll need to function as a nav should when clicked.

	- Create a default activeNav variable on nwNav's $scope and make it default to 'Notes'.
	- Create a function called getActiveNav in the controller of the nw-nav directive that returns the value of $scope.activeNav variable.
	- Create a function called setActiveNav on the controller of the nw-nav directive that sets the value of $scope.activeNav variable.
	- Return this from our controller.
