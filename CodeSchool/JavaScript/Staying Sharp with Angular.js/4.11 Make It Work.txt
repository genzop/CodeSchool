4.11 Make It Work
Using the included external library, SlabText, create a wrapper directive nwSlabText so that we can use it in the NoteWrangler app.

	- Create a link function for the nwSlabText directive.
	- Call the slabText() method on directive's element. Refer to the SlabText docs for the method name.
	- Add an attribute directive for nwSlabText to the h2 tag in the nw-card.html template.
	- We have a problem: the link function of the nwSlabText directive is being called before the element has been populated with data. To solve this, inject and use the $timeout service.
