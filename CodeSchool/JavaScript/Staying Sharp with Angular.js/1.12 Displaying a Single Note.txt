1.12 Displaying a Single Note
Use the routeParams service to fetch a single note based on the id given in the URL from the server URL /notes/:id.

An example of a possible URL for this might be: http://example.com/#/notes/42.

	- Inject the routeParams service into the NotesShowController so that we get access to the id in the URL.
	- Inject the $http service into the NotesShowController so we can use it to fetch a note.
	- Use the $http() function to fetch a note from the /notes/:id URL. Upon success, save the resulting data to a note variable on the controller.
