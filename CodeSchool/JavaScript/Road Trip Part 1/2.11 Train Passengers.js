/*2.11 Train Passengers
When these folks get on board, the new passenger count is reported to the conductor. Create a countMessage variable, and assign a String that uses numPassengers to say:

	Attention: There are now 3 passengers on the train!
	
Remember, no hard-coding values!*/

var numPassengers = 0;
numPassengers += 3
var countMessage = "Attention: There are now " + numPassengers + " passengers on the train!";
