/*2.14 String Concatenation
Use the same twenty20 variable, but change your variableâ€™s contents by reassigning it to the concatenation of the following characters:

	-The character at index 0 in "Never look back."
	-The character at index 3 in "Adventure is out there."
	-The character at index 14 in "Just keep swimming."
	-The character at index 1 in "To infinity... and beyond!"

Execute this concatenation in one line without declaring any extra variables. You can use a method to find the characters, or count very carefully.*/

vartwenty20 = "Never look back.".charAt(0) + "Adventure is out there.".charAt(3) + "Just keep swimming.".charAt(14) + "To infinity... and beyond!".charAt(1);
