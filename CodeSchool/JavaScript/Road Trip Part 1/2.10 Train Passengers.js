/*2.10 Train Passengers
Let’s say we start with an empty train at Death Valley National Park station. When the trains open for the day, 3 people get on board.
Declare a variable called numPassengers and set its value to 0. Then, increment the variable by 3, but without using the variable’s name twice in the new statement.*/

var numPassengers = 0;
numPassengers += 3;
