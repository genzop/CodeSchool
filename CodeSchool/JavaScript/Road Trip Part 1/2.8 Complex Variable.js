/*2.8 Complex Variable
Use one line of code to declare a variable called index14 and assign to it the character at index 14 in this string:

	"What can we do? Keep going!"

Try to use the charAt method on the string with something like this: "example string".charAt(index). Or you can assign the correct character to the variable by counting manually.*/

var index14 = "What can we do? Keep going!".charAt(14);
