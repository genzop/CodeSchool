/*3.3 Using File Paths to Reach a Source File
In the index.html file, add a <script> tag inside the <head> section to tell our HTML file that we want to execute some JavaScript code.

Call your JavaScript file oldFaithful.js. Here, the files are organized according to a file system structure, and your path is relative to the location of index.html.

	root/
  		sitepages/
    		index.html
  		scripts/
    		yellowstone/
      			oldFaithful.js*/

<html>
  <head>
    <script src = ../scripts/yellowstone/oldFaithful.js></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the JavaScript Express!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
