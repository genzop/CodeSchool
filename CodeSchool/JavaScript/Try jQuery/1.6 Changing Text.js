/*1.6 Changing Text
Now that we can see the price text, it's easy to change the value. Use the same method from the previous challenge, but this time change the price to $100.

	<div class="homepage-wrapper">
  		<h2>Welcome to jQuery Travels - Traversing the DOM since 2006</h2>
  		<p>Fly to New York today for as little as <yes><span>$100</span></yes></p>
	</div>
*/

$("span").text("$100");
