/*3.21 New Filter I
Let's add some result filtering options to our page. We want to be able to click on a filter and highlight the corresponding tours with a .highlight class. Go ahead and get started by creating the click handler for the .on-sale filter from the #filters list. Don't worry about the contents of the click handler function, we'll get it working in the next few challenges.*/

$(document).ready(function() {
  	$('#filters').on('click', '.on-sale', function(){
    
	});  
});
