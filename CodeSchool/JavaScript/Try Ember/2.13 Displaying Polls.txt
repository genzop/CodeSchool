2.13 Displaying Polls
Using the route data that you've just created, display and link to the Polls in the application.

	- List all of the polls on the polls template using the following HTML snippet. Use an {{#each}} iterator to loop over the Polls. Remember: model is the collection of Polls in the template.

		<h4>Check out previous questions from Woodland Wanderers:</h4>

		<ul>
		  {{!-- {{#each}} goes here --}}
		    <li>{{poll.question}}</li>
		  {{!-- don't forget to close the {{#each}} --}}
		</ul>

	- Update the Poll listing to {{#link-to}} each poll. To do so, link to the "polls.poll" route and don't forget to pass it the poll to show!
	- Display the Poll's question property on the polls/poll template within an <h3> element. You can replace the old "This is a poll." content from the last level.
