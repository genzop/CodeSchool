2.10 Nesting Routes
Nest the poll route under the new polls route that you've just created.

	- Convert the polls route into a parent route by adding a function parameter to it.
	- Convert the poll route from the last level into a child route of polls. You should need only to move the definition.
	- Customize the poll route's path to accept a poll_id dynamic segment.
	- Add a model hook to the poll route. Remember to capture the params being sent from the router.
	- Return the following object from the poll route's model hook:
		{ 
		  id: params.poll_id, 
		  question: 'This is poll #' + params.poll_id
		}
