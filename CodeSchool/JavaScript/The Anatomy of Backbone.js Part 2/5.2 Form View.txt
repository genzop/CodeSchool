5.2 Form View
Dr. Goodparts is sick with envy after coming back from rival Dr. Jay Query's office and seeing his slick Ajax form for creating new Appointments.

Our first step is to add a template to the AppointmentForm below. Have the template produce a form with two inputs, one for the title of the appointment and one for the name of the person on the appointment. So the "name" attributes on the inputs should be name and title, respectively. Yes, you'll have an input with name="name". YOLO.
