7.7 Index Route
Beautiful! But one problem: hitting the back button does update the URL in the browser correctly, but the DOM doesn't go back to being a list :(.

First, add the root route and point it to the index action.

As you can see we are passing in a appointmentList list collection in the router's initialize function. Finish out the index action by replacing the content of #app with the appointmentsView. Make sure you fetch new data for the appointmentList from the server.
