6.6 Reset All the Things
It's Monday morning and time to reset all the appointments for the week. You hear a screech from down the hall and seconds later Dr. Goodparts barges red-faced into your office because the DOM didn't update when he reset the collection.

Update the AppointmentListView to listen for the collection's reset event to call the render function.

Make sure you include the context argument to ensure render is called with the correct context.
