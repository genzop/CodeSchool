7.2 Creating Our First Router
Dr. Goodparts wants to add a link next to each appointment that will take him to a new page that will show just that single appointment. Easy enough.

He also wants it to be super-snappy and use the new HTML5 pushState API (he's strangely knowledgable of web-trends for a doctor).

So the first thing you have to do is create a new Backbone Router Class and name it AppRouter.
