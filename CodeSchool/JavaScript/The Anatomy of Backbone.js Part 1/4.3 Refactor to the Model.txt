4.3 Refactor to the Model
Whenever you see too much code dealing with the Model in one of your views, it's probably time for a refactor.

Create a cancel function in the Appointment model that sets the model's cancelled attribute to true, and call that function from the view. (Hint: Make sure to put the code in the correct tabs)
