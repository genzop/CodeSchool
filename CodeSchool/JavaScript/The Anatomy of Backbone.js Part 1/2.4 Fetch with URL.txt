2.4 Fetch with URL
Dr. Goodparts finally ponied up for a server and has seeded it with his first few appointments. Luckily for us, he bought the REST package with the JSON add-on.

Point the root URL of your Appointment model to the /appointments endpoint.

Then, create a new Appointment with an id of 1, and fetch its data from the server.
