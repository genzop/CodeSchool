/*2.7 Functionality in Functions
In order to add a bit of functionality to our Tour, let's pass in the nightly cost of the Tour when we create a new one - maybe 100 for now. In the Tour function, update the declaration to accept this new price argument.

In order to use this price, create a new function within the Tour named cost, which can be called with a number of nights. This cost function should console.log the number of nights multiplied by the price. We've added the call to cost within $(document).ready(), which you can uncomment once you've implemented.*/

function Tour(price) {
  	console.log("A new Tour was created");
  	this.cost = function (numNights){
    	console.log(price * numNights)
  	}
}

$(document).ready(function() { 
  	var tour = new Tour(100);
  	tour.cost(4);
});
