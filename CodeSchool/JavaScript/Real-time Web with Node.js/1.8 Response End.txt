1.8 Response End
Our original Hello server can be shortened since the response.end() function optionally takes data as a parameter. Remove the response.write line altogether, and send the hello string as a parameter on the response.end function. This will send the data, and once finished add the end to the response.

	- Instead of passing the content to response.write(), pass it to response.end().
	- Now, remove the call to response.write().
