The app.js code on the right side does not work. Once again we forgot to export our functions.

	- In the logger.js file, export the info function so we can use it in app.js by assigning it to the exports object.
	- In the logger.js file, export the warn function so we can use it in app.js by assigning it to the exports object.
	- In the logger.js file, export the error function so we can use it in app.js by assigning it to the exports object.
