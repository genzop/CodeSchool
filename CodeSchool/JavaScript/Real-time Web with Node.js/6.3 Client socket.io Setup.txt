6.3 Client socket.io Setup
In our html file, load the socket.io.js script and connect to the socket.io server.

	- Load the socket.io.js script. The socket.io.js path you should use is '/socket.io/socket.io.js'. Express knows to serve the socket.io client js for this path.
	- Using the global io object that's now available for us, connect to the socket.io server at http://localhost:8080.
