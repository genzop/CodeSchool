5.7 Express Server
Now, let's create an Express server which queries out for the search term and then returns the JSON.

	- Require the express module.
	- Create the Express server and name it app.
	- Create a route for GET requests to / (root path). Remember, the callback function takes two arguments: a request req and a response res.
	- In our new route, issue a request to searchURL and pipe the results into the response.
	- Finally, tell app to listen on port 8080.
