3.2 File Read Stream
Lets use the fs module to read a file and log its contents to the console.

	- Use the fs module to create a Readable stream for fruits.txt. Store the new stream in a variable called file.
	- Next, listen to the readable event on the newly created stream and give it a callback.
	- Inside the callback, read the data chunks from the stream and print them to the console using console.log() - you might want to use a while loop to do this. Don't forget to call toString() on the data before printing it.
