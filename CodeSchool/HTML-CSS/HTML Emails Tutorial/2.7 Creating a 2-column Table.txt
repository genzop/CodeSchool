2.7 Creating a 2-column Table
We need to create a table with 2 cells as columns. To visualize the layout as we go, we've started with adding the images.

	- Create a new container table with the attributes align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="600" and use a td tag to contain each new img that we've added to the markup.
	- Since some clients don't support max-width, add a width attribute with a value of 300 on each img.
	- Add vertical spacing to each column by applying padding-top of 15px to each cell containing an image.
