<!--4.8 Updating The Site Logo - bands.html
Our designers sent over a new Open Source Records logo, so instead of just writing the record label name with simple text, let's replace that text with an image.

1) Replace the h1 tag with an image element that displays osr-logo.png. Check out the site folder structure to find the path where that image is located. And don't forget to add an alt attribute to specify some alternate text too.
2) Removing that h1 tag and replacing it with a single image is what we wanted to do, but we've created several problems that will require us to modify our HTML and CSS. First, our logo text was centered, but our logo image is not. That's because our h1 heading tag was block-level, but our img tag is inline-level. Update the main.css file by adding a CSS selector for our .header img and set the display property to block.
3) Now that our image is a block-level tag, we can center it by using auto margins on the left and right sides. Set the margin property to 0 auto 15px auto, which will also add 15px of space between the logo and the site navigation.-->
