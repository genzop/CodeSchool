<!--3.7 Album Styles - prependers-band.html
This div-with-a-class thing is pretty useful - and it looks like there's another place we can use it too.

Our designers want a dashed border around each of the albums and their track listings, so we need to group the h4 and ol tags that contain each album's song list.

1) There's information about two albums, and each album consists of an h4 tag and an ordered list. Wrap each album name and track listing in their own divisions, and give those divisions a class attribute with the value album.
2) Now we can switch to main.css and target tags that have an album class in order to style them the way we want. Use a class selector to add a 2px dashed border to the albums. When you're writing the border property, use the single-line version.
3) That border is a little too close to our content, so add 10px of space to the top and bottom along with 5px of space to the left and right between the content and border. Use the single-line version of the padding property to add these four values.
4) That's looking better now - but the borders of each album division are touching up together, so add 5px of margin spacing between the two album divisions.-->
