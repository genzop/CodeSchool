<!--3.9 Cleaning Up The Bands Page - bands.html
The band pages are starting to look really good, but we've got a new problem. When we click back over to bands.html, the list of bands doesn't look very good even when we wrap that content in div containers with .header and .content-section classes.

This is because most of our layout styles on the band pages were specific to classes that aren't yet on bands.html.

1) Start by adding a class of bands-list to the unordered list of bands.
2) That border underneath the band names looks strange. This is because we have defined a very general rule for that heading tag. In the main.css file, define a more specific rule to remove the border for h3 tags inside of the .bands-list. Also, set the margin to 0 inside that same CSS selector.
3) Next, select the .bands-list and remove the default bullet points with the list-style-type property. Also, set the padding-left to 0 in order to remove the extra space before the band names.
4) Select only a tags that are children of the .bands-list and remove their underlines with the text-decoration property. Also, change their color to #ff2244.
5) Finally, add a 1px solid #555555 for the border around each of the li items in the .bands-list.-->
