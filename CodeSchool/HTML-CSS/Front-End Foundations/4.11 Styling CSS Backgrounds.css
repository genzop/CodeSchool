/*4.11 Styling CSS Backgrounds
Before we work on adding backgrounds with CSS to the Open Source Records page, let's practice with a temporary page here.

1) Set the background-color of the body to #d2d2d2 and the background-color of the .box to #badf00.
2) Now, modify the CSS so that the background-color of the body is still being used, but instead of the background-color property, use the shorthand background version. Use bg-body.png as the image, put the image in the top right of the container, and repeat it in all directions.
3) Finally, modify the CSS rule for the .box class by reworking the existing background-color into a single shorthand background property that displays the image bg-box.png, put the image at the top and center of the container, and repeat in the y direction with repeat-y.*/

body {
  background: #d2d2d2 url(bg-body.png) top right repeat;
}
.box {
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background: #badf00 url(bg-box.png) top center repeat-y;
}
