<!--4.13 Writing Text on CSS Backgrounds - about.html
The Prependers are putting out a new album soon, and Open Source Records wants to feature them on the About page. We'll do that with a container that shows a background image.

1) Under the paragraph in the content section, add an empty <div> container and give it a class of recording-now.
2) Switch over to main.css and select the new container with the .recording-now class selector. Set the dimensions of that container with a width of 440px and a height of 200px.
3) Now, add a background to that container with the following value: #ffffff url(images/prependers-recording.jpg) top left no-repeat
4) In the about.html file, create a <p> tag inside of that .recording-now container with the text Recording Album Now!.
5) Finally, select the .recording-now p and set the font-size to 28px. You can also experiment with different color values and see the changes in the Preview section.-->
