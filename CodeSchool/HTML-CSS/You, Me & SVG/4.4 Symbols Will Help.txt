4.4 Symbols Will Help
We are using the same two circle elements to make the flower blooms four different times! Let's use symbol to refactor our flower code!

  - Above the flower groups, create an empty symbol tag.
  - Take the two circle elements ( flower-outer and flower-inner) from one of the flower groups and put them in between the symbol opening and closing tag.
  - Give the symbol an id of bloom.
  - Now that we have our symbol, let's replace the two circle elements inside the first flower group with a use tag. Be sure to give the use tag an xlink:href with the value of #bloom.
  - Copy the use tag we just created over to the other flower groups. There should be four use tags to replace the circle elements in each flower group.
  - In order to use xlink:href, we need to include this attribute in our svg tag: xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink".
