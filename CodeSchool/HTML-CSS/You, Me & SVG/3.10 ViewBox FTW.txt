3.10 ViewBox FTW
Let's use a new viewBox coordinate system to ensure that our icon's width and height scales with our windows.

	- Remove the width and height attributes from the svg element.
	- Give our svg element a viewBox attribute. There is no need for values yet.
	- For the x, y, width, and height, set the viewBox attribute to 0 0 340 340.
	- Now that we've set the static numbers on our viewBox, let's adjust our viewport. In the style.css file, add a width of 30% and a height of auto to the svg selector.
