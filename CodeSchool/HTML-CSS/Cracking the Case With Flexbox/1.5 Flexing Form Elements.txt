1.5 Flexing Form Elements 
Flexbox will help us align form elements for our UI, but it would impact too many inputs if we make the form a flex container. Let's group some items to have them display on a single flex line.

To start, we have .fieldsets-group set to display: flex; in the forms.css file.

	- Add the fieldsets-group flex container class to the div containing the location fieldsets.
	- Wrap the two name items in a div container with our fieldsets-group flex container class.
