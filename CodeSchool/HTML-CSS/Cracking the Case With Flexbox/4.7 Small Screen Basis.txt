4.7 Small Screen Basis
We've added some space around items with padding. Now we want to use flexbox to reduce any lines to two items and set those items to split the space.

	- The line with the three items feels a bit cramped. Use the flexbox property and value to have those items wrap.
	- Set .fieldset-city to have a flex-basis of 100%.
	- Set .fieldset-state, .fieldset-zip, and .fieldset-1of2 to have a flex-basis of 50%.
