3.3 Aligning in a Page
We have styles set for our sign-in form, but no flexbox yet. We want the form to be vertically and horizontally centered.

	- Start by making the div containing the form a flex container.
	- Use the flexbox property and value to center the form on the main axis.
	- Use the flexbox property and value to center the form on the cross axis.
