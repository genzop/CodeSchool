4.8 Large Screen Basis
When there's enough room, we want to have the location items share a single line. Let's make some changes once the width is at least 600px.

	- Use the flex-basis property to set .fieldset-city to 50%.
	- Use the flex-basis property to set .fieldset-state to 35%.
	- Use the flex-basis property to set .fieldset-zip to 15%.
