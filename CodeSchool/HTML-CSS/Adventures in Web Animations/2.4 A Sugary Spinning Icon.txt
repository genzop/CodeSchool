2.4 A Sugary Spinning Icon 
Rotating objects is fun and eye-catching! Try using transforms to rotate the modal-close icon on hover to give our site a little more character.

	- Rotate the modal-close icon once, when hovered on, using transform.
	- Our close button spins in a circle instantly when we hover over it, which we canâ€™t really see. Add a transition that will animate our spin over 2s.
	- There are so many options when it comes to timing functions! Go ahead and try out a different timing-function other than the default ease for the transition.
