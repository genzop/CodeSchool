1.3 More Lists I
Our crew is made up of surveyors and architects, but only surveyors are represented in our @each loop at the moment. Use join() to combine the two lists into a variable called $crew. Ensure you change the @each declaration to loop over $crew after it's created. The foreman's obsession with the indented syntax has subsided, and you can now choose which syntax to use via the editor.
