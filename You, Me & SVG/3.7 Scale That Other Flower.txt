3.7 Scale That Other Flower 
Let's now make the fourth and final flower smaller like the first flower. Yay, symmetry!

	- Scale the last (fourth) flower by .8.
	- After the scale(), add another translate() to move the flower back down and over into its proper position using 55 for the X value and 71 for the Y value.
