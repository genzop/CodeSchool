3.2 Group All the Things
The windows that our designer exported for us seem to be in the wrong location. We can fix this easily by using groups.

	- Put the elements that create the right and left windows into one group.
	- Move the group to the right 72 and down 110 by using translate().
	- Give the group a class attribute of windows.
	- Add a .windows class inside our stylesheet to give the rect element inside our group a fill color of #3E9FD8.
	- Great! Now use the .windows class again to give the line elements a stroke of #E04E27 and a stroke-width of 4px.
