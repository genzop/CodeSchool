5.2 Route Instance
Let's rewrite our cities routes using a Route Instance.

	- Create a new Route Instance for the '/cities' URL path and assign it to the citiesRoute variable.
	- Move the code from our previous app.get() route to a new GET route on the citiesRoute object.
	- Move app.post() to citiesRoute.
	- Now, let's get rid of the citiesRoute temporary variable and use chaining function calls.
	- Finally, let's move the old routes for the '/cities/:name' URL path to use the new Route Instance API.
