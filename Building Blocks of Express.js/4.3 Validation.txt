4.3 Validation
The way that it is now, we are allowing new cities to be created with a blank description. Let's add some validation so that in order for a city to be created, its description must have a string length greater than 4.

	- Add an if block that checks for a description.length greater than 4, and move our city creation logic into that block. Use json() to send the results from createCity back to the client.
	- If description does not match its minimum length requirements, then set a 400 status code (Bad Request) to the response, and set the response body to Invalid City using json().
