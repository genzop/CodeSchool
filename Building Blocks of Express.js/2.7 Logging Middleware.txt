2.7 Logging Middleware
Help finish the following middleware code in the logger.js file:

	- On the response object, listen to the event that's emitted when the response has been handed off from Express to the underlying Operating System.
	- Inside of the finish callback, calculate the duration of the request by subtracting the startTime from a new Date object. Store the duration in the duration variable, which has already been declared for you.
	- Using the stream object, which holds a reference to standard out, write the following message: "This request took ____ ms", where ____ is the duration for the request.
	- If we run the code as is, the request will be stuck in our middleware. Call the function that moves processing to the next middleware in the stack.
