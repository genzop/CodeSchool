3.4 City Information
Now lets look up some information about the city.

	- Inside of our dynamic route, grab the name submitted by the user, lookup the city information on the cities object and assign it to the cityInfo variable.
	- Check to see if cityInfo exists and if so, respond with the cityInfo in JSON format.
	- If cityInfo does not exist, respond with a 404 HTTP status code and a JSON message that says "City not found".
