<!--1.2 Marking Up Headings
We've been hired to create a home page for Open Source Records. They've only got two bands on their roster, but they are growing fast, so let's get started!

1) On this page, the record label's name - Open Source Records - is the most important content, so mark it up with the appropriate tag.
2) The name of the band - The Prependers - is the next most important content, so mark it up with the appropriate tag.
3) The section titles - Bio, Members, Albums and Tour Dates - are of lesser importance than the name of the band, so mark those up with the appropriate tags.
4) Mark the band's album names - Top, Right, Bottom, Left, and Opacity Zero - each with the h4 tag.
5) Mark up the two paragraphs of the band's biography with the appropriate tags.
6) Mark up the band's tour message paragraph with the appropriate tag.-->
