<!--1.11 Site Menu 
There's more than one page on this website, so let's create a small menu to link to the other pages.

1) In regular-band.html, create an unordered list with three list items: About, Bands, and Contact that is in between the main site name and the band's name.
2) Make the text About into a link to the page about.html. If you need to, check the tab that contains a description of all of the files on the site server to decide how to create the link path.
3) Make the text Bands into a link to the page bands.html. If you need to, check the tab that contains a description of all of the files on the site server to decide how to create the link path.
4) Make the text Contact into a link to the page contact.html. If you need to, check the tab that contains a description of all of the files on the site server to decide how to create the link path.-->
