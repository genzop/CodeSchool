<!--3.2 Separating CSS - prependers-band.html

We've got some cool CSS and we'd like to make it available to every page on our site. It doesn't make sense to copy that CSS <style> block to every page, because that means we'll have to update all of them individually whenever we make a change.

Instead, let's move our CSS to a new file and link that to each page so our CSS is all in one spot.

1) Move all of the CSS in prependers-band.html over to a new file we've created in the 2nd tab called main.css.
2) Replace the style tag in prependers-band.html with a link tag that loads main.css.
3) Good job! Now copy that link tag to the header of bands.html so it can also enjoy the CSS rules in main.css.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel=stylesheet href=main.css>
  </head>
  <body>
