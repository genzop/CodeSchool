3.2 Displaying Reviews should seem repetitive
We added reviews to all the products, as you can see in the js file. Inside our Reviews tab display ALL the reviews for a product. Make sure you show the reviews body, author, and stars.

	- You need to create multiple li's for each review that exists.
	- Set the blockquote stars ( strong tag) to the review stars.
	- Add the review body between the strong & cite tags.
	- Set the cite to the review author.
