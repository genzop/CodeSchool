1.6 Not For Sale
We've added two new properties to our product that we can use on the HTML side. The first of these two is canPurchase, which is a boolean indicating if the product can be purchased. The second is soldOut which, as you can imagine, is a boolean indicating if the product is sold out.

Use these two new properties in our HTML page to solve the following objectives.

	- Use a directive to ensure that we can only see the "Add to Cart" button if the canPurchase property is true.
	- Our first gem is so popular that we've run out of stock already! Well, Flatlander gems are pretty rare, so it shouldn't be a big surprise. Luckily there is a soldOut property to our gem. When a gem is soldOut, hide the .product element.
