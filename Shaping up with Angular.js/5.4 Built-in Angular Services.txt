5.4 Built-in Angular Services
We can use the built-in $http Service to make requests to a server (or in our case a json file). Give our StoreController access to the products using a service.

	- Pass our store controller the $http Service.
	- get the store-products.json using the $http Service.
	- Attach a success to our get call.
	- Name the first parameter of the success function data.
	- Give our StoreController access to the products by setting products equal to the data given to us with the http service's success promise.
