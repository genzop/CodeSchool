5.2 Refactoring into a Module
After that we will need a way to encapsulate our directives in order to give our app access to them. We can use a module to do this! It is time for Module inception! There is a new js file provided for you â€” products.js; extract all store directives(descriptions, specs, reviews, title, gallery, and tabs) and paste them inside this new file. Then create a new module that we will make our original gemStore module require as a dependency.

	- Create a new Module named store-directives to encapsulate our store Directives.
	- Move the Directive definitions from app.js into products.js.
	- Give gemStore Module access to the directives by adding a dependency to gemStore's definition.
	- Link in the new products.js file.
