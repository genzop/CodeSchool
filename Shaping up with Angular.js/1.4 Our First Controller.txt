1.4 Our First Controller
In order to add some behavior to our application, we need a controller. Add a controller named StoreController to our gemStore application.

	- Add a controller named StoreController to our gemStore application.
	- Attach the StoreController to the <body> tag. Be sure to alias it as store.
	- In app.js, we've added a gem object to represent one of the products in our gemStore. Assign it to the product property of StoreController so we can use them in the page.
	- Display the name of the product inside the <h3> tag.
	- Display the price of the product inside the <em> tag.
