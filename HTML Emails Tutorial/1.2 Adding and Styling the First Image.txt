1.2 Adding and Styling the First Image
The first bit of content to add is an image at the top of the email. It needs a combination of HTML attributes and inline styles to appear correctly.

	- Begin by adding an img tag with a source of https://s3.amazonaws.com/unmasking-html-emails/info.png.
	- Set the alt text for the image to La Amor Peligrosa vs. La Fuega Fatal.
	- Add inline styles to the image to set its display property to "block" and max-width property to "100%".
	- Use the width attribute to set the width of the image to 600 pixels, keeping in mind that the width attribute defaults to pixels.
