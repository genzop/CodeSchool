1.6 Making It Dynamic
We've added a new component property called race inside our class. Fill in the empty template elements using this race property. The name should be in the <h2>, the date in the first <p> tag, and the about in the last <p> tag. Don't forget to click the "Check My Work" button when you think you have it right.
