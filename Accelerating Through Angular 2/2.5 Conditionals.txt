2.5 Conditionals
We've added a new boolean field called isRacing to each race. If isRacing is true then we've already entered this race, and if it's false we havenâ€™t. Notice in our template we have a button that will eventually allow us to enter the race, and an <h3> we want to display if we're already racing.

	- Add a conditional directive to only display the <button> if we're not racing.
	- Add a conditional directive to only display the <h3> if we are racing.
