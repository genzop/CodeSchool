5.8 Use the Component
With the option-tally component in place, use it in the results.

	- Fill out the option-tally component template by displaying the option vote count and percentage. The template should render something like:

		3 votes (33%)

	Where 3 is the component's optionVotes, and 33 is the percentage computed property.
	- Use the option-tally component in the polls.results template to replace the vote count and percentage placeholders.

	Remember to pass the optionVotes and pollVotes properties to the component.
