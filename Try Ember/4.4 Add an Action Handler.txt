4.4 Add an Action Handler
To prepare for the poll creation, you'll need an action handler to capture the form submission.

	- Add an actions block to the index route.
	- Within the actions block, add a createPoll() action handler function that accepts one poll parameter and "saves" the given poll using the following code:

		this.get('store').createPoll(poll);

	- Finally, after the poll is saved, transition the user to the "polls.poll" route from within the createPoll action handler. Don't forget to pass along the new model.
