/*4.13 Keyup Event
We've made a few changes to our tour page. Now we'll allow travelers to specify how many nights they want to book for their vacation. Write an event handler that will fire whenever the value within the keyup event is triggered on the #nights form field. The function can be empty now, then we'll implement it later.*/

$(document).ready(function() {
  	$('#nights').on('keyup',function(){
  	});
});
