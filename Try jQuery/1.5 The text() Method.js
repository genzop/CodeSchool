/*1.5 The text() Method
Great! You've selected the span element. The next thing to do is select the text() value of the span. Give that a try.

	<div class="homepage-wrapper">
  		<h2>Welcome to jQuery Travels - Traversing the DOM since 2006</h2>
  		<p>Fly to New York today for as little as <span>$299.99</span></p>
	</div>

$("span").text();
