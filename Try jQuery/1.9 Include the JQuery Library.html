/*1.9 Include the JQuery Library
In order to use jQuery, first we need to load it into our page. Update the following HTML to include the jquery.min.js library at the bottom of the page, just before the </body> tag.*/

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  	<head>
    	<title>Home</title>
  	</head>  
  	<body>
    	<div class="homepage-wrapper">
      		<h2>Welcome to jQuery Travels - Traversing the DOM since 2006</h2>
      		<p>Fly to New York today for as little as <span>$299.99</span></p>
    	</div>
  		<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
  	</body>
</html>
