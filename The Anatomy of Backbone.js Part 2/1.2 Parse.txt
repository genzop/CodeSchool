1.2 Parse
Welcome to the Anatomy of Backbone.js 2 challenges! Dr. Goodparts was so pleased with our work in Anatomy of Backbone.js 1 that he has hired us to continue working on his Appointment app.

The good Dr. recently had another team implement the server and they slightly messed up the format of the JSON returned for Appointment data. Instead of returning JSON like { "title": "Ms. Kitty Hairball Treatment", "cancelled": false, "id": 1 } the server is returning JSON like { "appointment": { "title": "Ms. Kitty Hairball Treatment", "cankelled": false, "identifier": 1 } }

Add to the parse function below code to handle return the JSON without the "appointment" as root.
