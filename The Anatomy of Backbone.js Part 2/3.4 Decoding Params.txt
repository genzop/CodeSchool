3.4 Decoding Params
The Server Team is at it again and has added the ability to select a page and the per page using natural language. So instead of page 25, they can now accept "twenty five". Our page route function should work as is but it needs to be able to handle encoded params. To fix this, decode the page and per_page params in the page function.
