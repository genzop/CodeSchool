1.10 Outside Controller
In order for a new note to be created by a user on the new notes page, we need to add a controller and use the $http service to create a new note. This time around, we'll use an external controller for the new notes page.

	- Attach the NotesCreateController to the new notes route.
	- Give the controller an alias we can reference in the template.
	- Use the ngModel directive to save the data from each form input and textarea in a model called note. Remember the data key on the model matches the form input name. Look at the description textarea in the notes/new.html template for an example.
	- Use the ngClick directive to call the saveNote() function of the controller when the save button is clicked. Remember to pass the note model to the function.
