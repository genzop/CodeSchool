4.4 Using Parent Functionality
We've created the isActive() and activate() functions on the scope of the nwNavItem directive. Within these functions, we'll need to access the controller of the nwNav directive to set and get which nav item is active.

	- First, we need a name for the nav item to work. Create a new isolate scope on the nwNavItem directive and allow it to accept an attribute (@) value called name.
	- Within the isActive() function, call the getActiveNav() function from the required controller to get the current active nav value. Compare the return value from the controller with the scope.name value and return the result from the isActive function.
	- We need a way to set the active nav value when a nav item is clicked. In our activate() function, call the setActiveNav() function on the require'd controller and pass the scope.name as an argument.
