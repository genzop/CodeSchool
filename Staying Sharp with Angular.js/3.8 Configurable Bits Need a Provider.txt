3.8 Configurable Bits Need a Provider
We want to be able to configure the characterLength before Tweetable runs. Refactor the Tweetable factory into a provider and expose a setLength() function that will allow us to set a characterLength in our app config.

	- Change the factory definition into a provider definition.
	- Wrap the existing function returned by our TweetableProvider() function in a call to the $get() function required by providers. Don't forget to move the $http service injection!
	- Create a setLength() function attached to the provider that sets the characterLength variable.
