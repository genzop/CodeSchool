2.12 Style the Tweeted Note
Some notes have been altered to have a tweeted property set to a timestamp of when that note was tweeted.

	{
	  "tweeted": "603590400"
	}

We want to be able to edit how the card looks if it has been tweeted. Let's use the link function to access the directive's element.

	- Create a link function in the directive and include the parameters we will need to grab element.
	- Add a class of tweeted to the nw-card element for any card that has a tweeted property on its scope.
