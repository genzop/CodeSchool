3.5 A Tweetable Service
There is an outside Tweet Validator API that we want to use in our NoteWrangler application. We have already created a tweetable.js file and included it in our index.html file. Now, it's factory building time!

	- Let's create a Tweetable service to use the Tweet Validator API across our application. To begin, let's name our service ''Tweetable'', inject $http and have our factory function return an anonymous function.
	- Inside the factory, make a POST request with the $http() function to this endpoint:

		http://gentle-spire-1153.herokuapp.com/tweet

	The service function should accept a single argument, potentialTweet, that will be sent to the external API. Use the Tweet Validator API documentation to determine how to construct the data of our POST request.

	Return your $http() call so we can use it later.
	- Inject our brand spankin' new Tweetable service into NotesIndexController and then define a new tweetThatNote() function on $scope that we can use to query the remote API from our app.
	- Within our tweetThatNote() function, invoke the Tweetable service and console.log() the returned status. To use our new Tweetable service, our tweetThatNote() function should accept an argument, the description from a note, that we then pass into Tweetable().
	- Using the button tag within our notes/index.html template, invoke the new method we defined on $scope from NotesIndexController and pass in the note's description attribute.
