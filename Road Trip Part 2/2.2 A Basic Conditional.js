/*2.2 A Basic Conditional
In countdown.js, modify the while loop with a conditional that will only allow a number to be printed if it is even. Your results should be the even numbers from 10 to 2 in descending order. Think carefully about how your code might decide if a number is evenâ€¦*/

var num = 10;

while (num > 0) {
  if(num % 2 == 0){
    console.log(num);
  }
  num--;
