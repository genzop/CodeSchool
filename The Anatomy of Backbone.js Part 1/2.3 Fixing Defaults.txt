2.3 Fixing Defaults
While messing around in the console, you've discovered a strange bug. Every new Appointment you create has the same exact date, instead of the date and time of when the Appointment instance was created.

This is because new Date() is evaluated once, when the Appointment model is first created, and not re-evaluated every time a new instance is created.

To fix this you'll want to assign a function to defaults instead of just a plain object. Wrap the object below in a function which returns the object. This will cause the defaults to get evaluated every time a new instance is created.
