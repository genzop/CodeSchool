7.8 App Organization
We are so close to wrapping up! Before we go, let's use our Router to clean up our app a bit.

First, instead of assigning a Router class to AppRouter, just create the Router instance.

Next, instead of passing in the appointmentList collection in initialize, create an instance of AppointmentList and assign it to this.appointmentList.

Add a start function to the router to start our Backbone history with pushState on.

Finally, call the router's start function from inside a jQuery ready function to ensure we don't start updating the DOM before it's ready.
