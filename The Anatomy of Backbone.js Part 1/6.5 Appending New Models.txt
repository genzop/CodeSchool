6.5 Appending New Models
Uh oh. Dr. Goodparts is at it again, adding new models to the collection, and he's upset because when he adds a model, the DOM isn't updated.

In the AppointmentListView's initialize function, listen for the collections add event and call the addOne function to append the new model to the view.

Make sure you include the context argument to ensure addOne is called with the correct context.
